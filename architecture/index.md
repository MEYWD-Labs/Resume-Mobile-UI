# Resume-Mobile-UI - Mobile User App Architecture

## Overview

This directory contains the architecture documentation for the Resume-Mobile-UI application, which is the React Native mobile application for iOS and Android users. This app provides the primary user interface for job seekers to create, manage, and share their professional resumes on mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React Native
- **State Management**: Context API / Redux (as specified in mobile-architecture-strategy.md)
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers (serverless)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure token storage
- **Offline Support**: AsyncStorage / SQLite for local data persistence
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) / Apple Push Notification service (APNs)

## Getting Started

To understand the mobile architecture:

1. Start with `mobile-architecture-strategy.md` for the overall technical approach
2. Review `user-flows.md` to understand the user experience and interaction patterns
3. Reference `design-system-ui-standards.md` for UI implementation guidelines
4. Consult `api-contracts.md` and `authentication-flow.md` for backend integration
5. Use `performance-scaling-strategy.md` for optimization best practices

## Notes

- This documentation focuses exclusively on the mobile user-facing application
- Admin and backend-specific architecture files are not included here
- For full system architecture, refer to the main docs/architecture directory in the MEYWD-Labs repository
